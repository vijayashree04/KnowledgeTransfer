The system is critical, as any downtime directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction for operations teams and external partners.\n\n2.  **Key Processes Described:**\n    The system handles the following core processes:\n    *   **Order Intake:** Orders are received via an API.\n    *   **Validation:** Incoming orders undergo validation.\n    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Validated orders are sent to Kafka for asynchronous processing.\n    *   **Fulfillment:** Orders are processed towards fulfillment.\n    *   **Data Storage:** Processed order data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.\n    *   **Reporting:** Daily reports are generated from the system data.\n\n3.  **Important Contacts / Ownership:**\n    *   **Product Owner:** Ananya\n    *   **Tech Lead:** Ravi\n    *   **Operations Contact:** Suresh\n\n4.  **Key Decisions Made (Implied by Design):**\n    The architectural and technological choices reflect the key decisions for the system's implementation:\n    *   **Technology Stack:** The system is built using Python with FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, Kafka for messaging, and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n    *   **High-Level Architecture:** An API-first approach for order intake, an asynchronous processing model leveraging Kafka, and a robust database for data persistence were chosen to support the end-to-end order flow and daily reporting.",

Purpose of the document:**\nThe primary purpose of this document is to provide essential instructions for setting up and running the backend service in a local development environment. It also serves as a quick reference for the repository's structural organization and highlights critical operational policies.\n\n**2. Key processes described:**\nThe document details the following key processes:\n*   **Local Setup:** A step-by-step guide for getting the service running locally, including cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and executing the service.\n*   **Code Navigation:** Outlines the repository's structure, indicating the location of API routes (`/api`), core business logic (`/services`), and shared utility functions (`/utils`).\n\n**3. Important contacts / ownership:**\nThe provided document content does not specify any important contacts or ownership details for the backend service.\n\n**4. Key decisions made:**\nTwo critical operational decisions or policies are clearly stated:\n*   **Secret Management:** Secrets must never be committed to the repository, emphasizing a strong security practice.\n*   **Local Testing Data:** Local testing environments should exclusively use test data, implying that real or production data should not be utilized during local development.",
